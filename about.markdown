I'm a self-taught visual communicator with a specific focus on copywriting and communicative design. I love working closely with founders, small teams, and non-profits to help create the written or visual content that they need to build and grow. Sure, I work by myself, but that allows a pure collaboration between you and me, providing an atmosphere for producing great work.  

I provide strategy, branding, design, writing, art direction, film, and photography services.
