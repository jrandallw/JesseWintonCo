  title: Executive Summary
  body: The proposal is for the design and development of a portfolio website for
    Eric Stern. The focus will be clean, minimal design, developed with the ability
    to create content within the Siteleaf content management system that will be flexible,
    and can adapt to allow for multiple presentations based on the project’s type
    i.e. different layouts for video vs. garment design.

  title: Design
  body: In the design process, we create the layouts for each page, incorporating
    many elements including the needs of each page, the requirements for displaying
    different project types, inspiration from other portfolio sites in similar sectors
    etc. and we build. We’ll be able to work closely together to create exactly what
    you need to make a clean, scaleable site that can grow with your company.

  title: Development
  body: One the design process is completed and approved, I’ll take the completed,
    approved designs and turn them into a fully functioning website, built with the
    Siteleaf content management system. Siteleaf will allow you to update your website
    as necessary, easily add in new work, and deploy your site for relatively low
    cost. Included in this part of the process will be a time of training, helping
    to ease you into the learning curve of a new content management system.

  title: Final Thoughts
  body: The goal with this site is to create something that stands out. In any creative
    sectors, there are many competitors, but the majority of them that I've seen have
    less than stellar portfolio sites. They are too generic, too old, too busy, poorly
    designed. We will make this portfolio stand out through a number of factors.
