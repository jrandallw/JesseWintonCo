The proposal is for the design and development of a portfolio website for Eric Stern. The focus will be clean, minimal design, developed with the ability to create content within the Siteleaf content management system that will be flexible, and can adapt to allow for multiple presentations based on the projectâ€™s type i.e. different layouts for video vs. garment design.
