    in the modern business landscape, there is perhaps nothing more vital to the continued success and growth of a company than social media. across all sectors of business, companies with a strong social media presence are able to continuously and consistently connect with their clients, leading to strong interpersonal relationships, and continued trust predicated on the personal touch and humanity you can demonstrate through social media. as of 2017, facebook has over 2 billion active monthly users, twitter has over 300 million active monthly users, and instagram has 600 million monthly active users, and more importantly within the construction sector, linkedin has 450 million active monthly users.

    the most effective marketing happens over time when quality meets consistency. we will create consistent, quality content in the following ways:

    * installation of metrics systems such as google analytics
    * social content
    * photographs
    * strategic short films
    * written content

    bellavista’s best asset for growth is, and will likely continue to be, predicated on a strong relationship with property managers and residential homeowners throughout northern california. the strategy has been to create a culture where clients feel personally cared for, while blvs operates on a large scale level; a small-scale feel with large-scale capabilities and quality.

    using the tools listed above, we’ll build on the existing concept, and be able to build out a solid marketing strategy that will help blvs achieve it’s goals for growth on digital platforms over the next 2-3 years.

    **_installation & use of google analytics_**

    google analytics is a web analytics service that is installed to measure user input on a website. it can track page views, seeing which pages users navigate to, can measure the amount of time spent on each page to view which content most draws users, and can provide information as to what sent the user to the website, i.e. if they were sent from a bvls newsletter, through facebook or other social media platforms etc. giving you the tools to be able to measure digital engagement with the content that you’ve provided on the site, and strategically place content according to those metrics.

    **_measuring social media metrics_**

    in the first steps of the strategic development process, we’ll plan out 1-2 months worth of social media content across all platforms, specifically linkedin, facebook, instagram, pinterest, medium, and houzz. this content will include photographs of properties, written stories of staff, email newsletters, photo journals telling stories of the company, and sharing pertinent articles and content from within the landscape & construction industry. the goal of this will be to build an audience, measure audience engagement, and use the metrics that we’ve gathered to plan future social media content. this is how we can start to develop our long-term social media strategy, utilizing the data that we collect to push the most effective content.
