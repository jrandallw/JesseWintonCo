    In the modern business landscape, there is perhaps nothing more vital to the continued success and growth of a company than social media. across all sectors of business, companies with a strong social media presence are able to continuously and consistently connect with their clients, leading to strong interpersonal relationships, and continued trust predicated on the personal touch and humanity you can demonstrate through social media. As of 2017, Facebook has over 2 billion active monthly users, Twitter has over 300 million active monthly users, and Instagram has 600 million monthly active users, and more importantly within the construction sector, LinkedIn has 450 million active monthly users.

    The most effective marketing happens over time when quality meets consistency. We will create consistent, quality content in the following ways:

    * Installation of metrics systems such as google analytics
    * Social Content
    * Photographs
    * Strategic Short Films
    * Written Content

    BellaVista’s best asset for growth is, and will likely continue to be, predicated on a strong relationship with property managers and residential homeowners throughout Northern California. The strategy has been to create a culture where clients feel personally cared for, while blvs operates on a large scale level; a small-scale feel with large-scale capabilities and quality.

    Using the tools listed above, we’ll build on the existing concept, and be able to build out a solid marketing strategy that will help blvs achieve it’s goals for growth on digital platforms over the next 2-3 years.

    **_installation & use of google analytics_**

    google analytics is a web analytics service that is installed to measure user input on a website. it can track page views, seeing which pages users navigate to, can measure the amount of time spent on each page to view which content most draws users, and can provide information as to what sent the user to the website, i.e. if they were sent from a bvls newsletter, through facebook or other social media platforms etc. giving you the tools to be able to measure digital engagement with the content that you’ve provided on the site, and strategically place content according to those metrics.

    **_measuring social media metrics_**

    in the first steps of the strategic development process, we’ll plan out 1-2 months worth of social media content across all platforms, specifically linkedin, facebook, instagram, pinterest, medium, and houzz. this content will include photographs of properties, written stories of staff, email newsletters, photo journals telling stories of the company, and sharing pertinent articles and content from within the landscape & construction industry. the goal of this will be to build an audience, measure audience engagement, and use the metrics that we’ve gathered to plan future social media content. this is how we can start to develop our long-term social media strategy, utilizing the data that we collect to push the most effective content.

    **_strategic short films_**

    in the social media market, one of the most heavily engaged content types is video. in 2017, hubspot reported that 74% of all internet traffic was video content, and by 2019, cisco has projected that 90% of all internet traffic will be video. this places a high importance on video content for bella vista.

    in early 2018, jw/co produced the first in a series of short films for eyecenter optometric, telling the story of their founder. the short is meant to create a vision for who they are: a company with a small-business mindset operating on a large scale across the area. we will plan to create similar videos, telling the story of bvls. the specific content and stories will be planned out at a later time, but we will create a series of shorts to utilize on social media, and the bvls website.

    **_photo journals & company stories_**

    along with video content, there is significant data to prove that users engage most fully with content that includes imagery. we can create and tell stories of staff members, of the company itself, of specific properties that blvs transformed, coupled with photographs that will be shot to help tell those stories. this is a somewhat new genre of marketing type- essentially a photo journal that weaves together a narrative with the visuals, tying the story of bvls to the power of photographic content. these stories and photos can be shared on social networks like pinterest, houzz, facebook, instagram, and [medium](http://medium.com/), where we can create a corporate blog and utilize their format to help share the story of your company.
