  title: Executive Summary
  body: |-
    Our purpose is to tell your story by exploring how EyeCenter Optometric has kept family values at the forefront of their business for 57 years.

    People have a distinct desire to be a part of a family. Dr. Fred’s story is visually and verbally showing the connection between him in his own family, which brings authenticity to him as an individual, and the business. Through exploring his upbringings, the company’s beginnings, interactions with his family, and the connection of his family values with the company, the audience will not only gain a deeper understanding of the roots of EyeCenter but also a desire for themselves be apart of the EyeCenter family. Dr. Fred embodies what your company is today and represents those values in his personal life.
