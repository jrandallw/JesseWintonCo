  body: "**Purpose //** To tell your story by exploring how EyeCenter Optometric has
    kept family values at the forefront of their business for 57 years.\n \L\n**Synopsis
    //** People have a distinct desire to be a part of a family. Dr. Fred’s story
    is visually and verbally showing the connection between him in his own family,
    which brings authenticity to him as an individual, and the business. Through exploring
    his upbringings, the company’s beginnings, interactions with his family, and the
    connection of his family values with the company, the audience will not only gain
    a deeper understanding of the roots of EyeCenter but also a desire for themselves
    be apart of the EyeCenter family. \nDr. Fred embodies what your company is today
    and represents those values in his personal life. \n\n**\LVisual Story //** The
    story will start with shots of his ranch, barn, and surroundings to set the stage.
    Dr. Fred will be introduced by either driving his car down into the driveway or
    out in the fields tending to his animals and livestock. As we move into his upbringing,
    childhood, and past we will have Dr. Fred holding old Polaroid pictures and or
    explore artistic imagery (for example if he talked about how basketball was his
    favorite thing, we will have him sitting looking at a basketball court, holding
    a ball, or some of his old uniforms in a trunk in his room) to make the story
    come to life. Dr. Fred’s lessons learned in childhood naturally will ignite his
    passion for serving the community through eye glass care. During this section
    of the film, Dr. Fred will be using and fixing old optometry tools and glasses
    in his barn or another suitable location. The purpose of using old eye glass tools
    and methods is to demonstrate the 57 year old historical significance of the Eye
    Center. To keep with the artistic theme, we also may explore projecting an eye
    examination onto a wall in his home. \n\nAs he speaks more about family, his current
    family will arrive at his home. Continuing to allow the ranch as a central character
    in the story we will have the family use the property to it’s fullest potential.
    \n\nThe film ends with Dr. Fred in a tent with his young grandchildren laughing
    and playing together. This is the central image to the whole film because it embodies
    who Dr. Fred is and the values Eye Center Optometric holds. Text comes on the
    screen, “A Big Family From Day One” and the logo comes on the screen."
