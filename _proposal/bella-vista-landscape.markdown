- title: Executive Summary
  type: text
  body: "In the modern business landscape, there is perhaps nothing more vital to
    the continued success and growth of a company than social media. Across all sectors
    of business, companies with a strong social media presence are able to continuously
    and consistently connect with their clients, leading to strong interpersonal relationships,
    and continued trust predicated on the personal touch and humanity you can demonstrate
    through social media. As of 2017, Facebook has over 2 billion active monthly users,
    Twitter has over 300 million active monthly users, and Instagram has 600 million
    monthly active users, and more importantly within the construction sector, LinkedIn
    has 450 million active monthly users.\n\nThe most effective social media marketing
    happens over time when quality meets consistency. We will create consistent, quality
    content in the following ways:\n\n* Social Content\n* Company Updates\n* Photographs\n*
    Strategic Short Films\n* Written Content\n\nBella Vista's best asset for growth
    is, and will likely continue to be predicated on a strong relationship with property
    managers throughout Northern California. Utilizing LinkedIn, our goal will be
    to use the content that we create to engage property managers and showcase the
    high-quality of work that Bella Vista is capable of achieving. \n\n"
