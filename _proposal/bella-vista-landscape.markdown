  title: Executive Summary
  body: In the modern business landscape, there is perhaps nothing more vital to the
    continued success and growth of a company than social media. Across all sectors
    of business, companies with a strong social media presence are able to continuously
    and consistently connect with their clients, leading to strong interpersonal relationships,
    and continued trust predicated on the personal touch and humanity you can demonstrate
    through social media. As of 2017, Facebook has over 2 billion active monthly users,
    Twitter has over 300 million active monthly users, and Instagram has 600 million
    monthly active users.
