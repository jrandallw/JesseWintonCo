  title: Executive Summary
  body: |-
    House heist is a new business that intends to help train entrepreneurs to flip real estate effectively. This proposal is for the design and development of a front-facing marketing site, integrating the existing HouseHeist branding into a strong, dynamic, flexible, and functional site.

    HouseHeist will serve not only as a business, but, through the training that you will be providing, it will also serve to help you create name recognition, adding value to your personal brand, and providing you with the opportunity to book speaking engagements and train other business owners in the trade that you’ve mastered.

    **_Update – 02.14.18:_**
    Reducing the price for this proposal to suit the start-up needs of HouseHeist will include a few limiting factors:
    
    * There will be **_one_** draft of the website created in the design process. 
    * The number of revisions allowed in the design and development phases will be **_five_** total. Revisions constitute any changes to the initially presented design concept.
    * The schedule will be amended to allow for a longer turnaround, allowing for the price to be reduced.
    * Forestry is now a recommended CMS, reducing the yearly maintenance costs of the site.

  title: Design
  body: "Creating a solid marketing site begins with design. In the design process,
    I’ll build out the layouts for the site,          taking into account:\n\n* How
    the design fits in with the existing brand, staying within any style guidelines.
    \n* How the design compliments the information you’re presenting.\n* How the design
    can continue to be expanded into the future as HouseHeist continues to grow and
    build.\n\nFirst in this process will be creating a mood board, finding existing
    sites and brands from which we can pull specific inspiration, even down to individual
    pages and their designs, layouts, and information structure.\nFrom there, the
    designs of the pages will be created, utilizing the information and ideas that
    have been gleaned to build the specific look of HouseHeist’s website. Throughout
    this process, we’ll collaborate on the pages as they’re created, discussing the
    designs, revising them according to feedback, brainstorming new approaches, and
    finalizing how the site will be laid out. Once the designs are approved, we will
    move into the development of the site."

  title: Development
  body: "This phase of the process involves taking the approved designs and turning them into a functional website, developing     each page, developing all content, and setting up hosting, backups, and deployment to a live web environment.
    There are two different possible platforms that could be used to create the website:

    * **_Update – 02.14.18:_** Forestry (free- recommended)- Forestry is a content management system for static websites. One of the big benefits of Forestry is the fact that it does not require a database, which removes the need to pay for yearly hosting. It is quick, powerful, flexible, and easy to use, benefitting from many features that are similar to Craft and Wordpress, while leading the pack in terms of speed and quick load times.

    * CraftCMS ($199- recommended)- Craft CMS is a content management system that places it’s primary emphasis on the content, allowing users to create what they need, but not forcing them to have unneeded content- blog, etc. At it’s core, Craft takes the beneficial elements of WordPress, ease-of-use, functionality, power, and flexibility, and strips it of the unnecessary elements. It comes with a one-time charge of $199, but provides a full-feature set.

    * Wordpress (free)- WordPress is a tried and true CMS that powers millions of websites around the world. It’s main draws are it’s power, it’s flexibility, technical support system, and the fact that it’s well known to almost anyone who would be involved in the use and management of the site.

    These two systems would both adequately fulfill the needs that HouseHeist has. Craft is recommended because of it’s content forward nature, focusing first and foremost on the needs of the  site, and stripping the CMS of the unnecessary parts."

  title: Final Thoughts
  body: The focus with the HouseHeist site will be creating brand awareness, allowing
    it to continue to expand, and creating name recognition for you, allowing you
    to seek out speaking engagements and formal training environments, eventually
    creating a community similar to Gary Vaynerchuck, Grant Cordone, Jay Morrison
    etc. To do this, we need to build a powerful beautiful website, that will allow
    you to not only advertise yourself, but also to establish yourself as having quality,
    and professionalism.
