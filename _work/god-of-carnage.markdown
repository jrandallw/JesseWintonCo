Personal project designing a poster for the 2009 Broadway play _God of Carnage._ A personal favorite, "armed?" is an opening line to the show, and, to me, represents the madness that's about to unfold. With this design, I took an extremely minimalist approach and inspiration from [Saul Bass](http://www.saulbassposterarchive.com).
