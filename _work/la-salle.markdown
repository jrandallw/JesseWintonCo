Partnering with Bella Vista Landscape, I produced a series of shots of their landscape remodel at La Salle Apartments, Davis, CA. When they completed the process of building a new courtyard, planting new plants, and building out a river bed that stretched throughout the entire complex, I helped the capture the essence of their new, modern design.
