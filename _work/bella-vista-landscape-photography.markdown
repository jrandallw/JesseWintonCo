Partnering with Bella Vista Landscape, I produced a large series of shots of their new landscape remodel at the La Salle Apartments in Davis, CA. Building a new courtyard, planting new plants, and building out a river bed that stretched throughout the entire complex, I helped the capture the essence of their new, modern design.
