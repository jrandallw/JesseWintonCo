  body: "In the modern business landscape, there is perhaps nothing more vital to
    the continued success and growth of a company than social media. Across all sectors
    of business, companies with a strong social media presence are able to continuously
    and consistently connect with their clients, leading to strong interpersonal relationships,
    and continued trust predicated on the personal touch and humanity you can demonstrate
    through social media."
